## About Me
I am an AI and business enthusiast, currently studying Business Administration (BBA).  
My goal is to create a bridge between technology and business.  
I believe that the right data and automation not only simplify a process but are also the main driving force behind defining business strategy and bringing revolutionary change.

## What I Do
I automate your complex data processes and use them to build intelligent systems for your business.

### How my solutions can help you:
- **Unlocking Your Data's Power**  
  Wasting time finding the right information from your internal knowledge base or documents?  
  I can turn your data into a high-fidelity RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.  
  As a result, you or your team can find answers to any question in an instant.

- **Automated Market Intelligence**  
  Is keeping an eye on your competitors a manual task?  
  My custom-built intelligent web extraction system automatically tracks competitors' activities.  
  You will receive direct reports at specified times.

- **Complete Data Pipeline**  
  Have a lot of data but it's not ready for use?  
  I build a complete automated pipeline that collects data from various sources, cleans it using NLP, and prepares it for analysis.

## Featured Project: n8n Workflow Automation Brain
A real-world example of a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline:

- **Intelligence Layer:** Collects relevant information from thousands of online documents  
- **Processing Pipeline:** Cleans data and creates a vectorized knowledge base  
- **Real-time Response:** Accurate answers to any automation-related questions  
- **Platform:** An intelligent assistant for the n8n automation platform
